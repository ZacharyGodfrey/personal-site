<p class="text-center">Hi, I'm Zach. I'm a software engineer based in Florida and I've been developing software since 2013. My aim is to write software that I am proud of; I believe that a job well done is its own reward. I'm motivated by a sense of wonder and a desire for continual learning. Along the way, I also enjoy putting software concepts into simple terms for non-technical people.</p>

<p class="text-center">If you share these values, we'd probably make a great team! You can learn more about me and reach out to me using the following links.</p>
