## {frontmatter.title}

I'm primarily a back-end engineer, so my UI design in these projects likely won't impress you. I built these projects either to solve an interesing problem or to explore a new concept (new to me, anyway).

### AxeDB

I created [AxeDB](https://axedb.netlify.app) to supplement the official stats website for IATF axe throwing. In addition to providing in-depth performance statistics for Premier axe throwers, the site also implements an alternative rating system based on overall accuracy rather than wins and losses.

With this site, I wanted to explore using SQLite to store the scraped data in files in the repository so that all of the code and data can be downloaded together with a single command and run locally with no dependencies on external services. Other than GitHub's 50MB file size limitation, this implementation actually went really well. However, as the number of competitors grew it became cumbersome to have thousands of database files in the repo.

### Pub Subs

I made this [simple page](https://pubsubs.netlify.app) to display whether Publix Chicken Tender Subs are on sale. They're a local favorite item, and I thought it would be a fun little project that makes use of a publicly available API.

The UI is nothing to be impressed by, but I thought the method of getting the data was pretty cool. The project uses a GitHub action triggered on a cron schedule to hit the API endpoint once a week when the sales week starts. The JSON response from the API endpoint is stored as a file in the repository.

When the GitHub action pushes the JSON file change back to the repository, it triggers a new build of the site in Netlify. The site keeps itself up to date with no manual intervention, costs me nothing, and is as simple as a single static web page.
