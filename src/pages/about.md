## About Me

I'm married to Claire and we have two children.

I'm extremely introverted and a former "Gifted" kid.

I have a long list of interests including:

- Chess
- Rubik's cubes (my biggest solve is the 5x5x5)
- Video games (both playing and making them)
- Cryptography
- 3D modeling, parametric CAD
- Rock climbing, rope skills, self-rescue
- Axe throwing
