# Hi, I'm Zach.

  <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong>

## Work

I have *more than a decade* of [experience](/work) building and maintaining software in a variety of languages and technology stacks. I'm currently working at [The Knot](https://theknot.com) where I'm focused on our marketplace search platform.

## Projects

Most of my work has either been on internal systems that cannot be shared or on back-end systems that aren't visible. Because of this, I don't have a pretty portfolio of real work to show. However, you can check out my [personal projects](/projects) to see what I've built outside of work.

## Writing

I enjoy writing, but it's not something I do often. I like to write [Haiku poems](/haiku) to share topics that I find interesting, I made up a few original [bedtime stories](/bedtime-stories) for my kids, and I write [blog posts](#blog-posts) *very infrequently*.

## Fun

I enjoy rock climbing - mostly indoors these days, though I have also led a handful of sport routes outside. My biggest accomplishment so far is a 400-foot multipitch route called *Playin' Hooky* near Golden, Colorado.

I used to throw axes competitively in the IATF. In my first year in the sport, I qualified for and competed in the *2023 International Axe Throwing Championship*. From more than 20,000 throwers worldwide, the top 256 were selected to compete in the event. I placed 97th overall, which is in the top half for the tournament and the top 0.5% globally.
