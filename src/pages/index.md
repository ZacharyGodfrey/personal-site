## Hello!

**Hey, I'm Zach.** I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [The Knot](https://theknot.com). I'm also a husband and father and a competitive axe thrower.

### About

I have *over a decade* of [experience](/work) building and maintaining software in a variety of languages and tech stacks.

Outside of work, I [throw axes](https://axescores.com/player/1207260) in the IATF. In my first year in the sport, I qualified for and competed in the *2023 International Axe Throwing Championship*. From more than 20,000 throwers worldwide, the top 256 were selected to compete in the event. I placed 97th overall, which is in the top half for the tournament and the top 0.5% globally.
