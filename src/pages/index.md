### Work

I have more than *a decade* of experience building and maintaining software in a variety of languages and technology stacks. Most of my work has either been on internal systems that cannot be shared or on back-end systems that aren't visible. Because of this, I don't have a pretty portfolio of work to show. However, you can check out my personal projects to see what I've built outside of work.

### Fun

I throw axes competitively in the IATF. In my first year in the sport, I qualified for and competed in the *2023 International Axe Throwing Championship*. From more than 20,000 throwers worldwide, the top 256 were selected to compete in the event. I placed 97th overall, which is in the top half for the tournament and the top 0.5% globally.
