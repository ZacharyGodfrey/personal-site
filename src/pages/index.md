## Hey, I'm Zach.

I'm a [Senior Software Engineer](#work), husband and father, and competitive [axe thrower](https://axescores.com/player/1207260). You can read more about me [here](/about).

## Work

I have over a decade of experience building and maintaining web applications in a variety of languages and tech stacks. I'm currently working at [The Knot](https://www.theknot.com). My personal code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ZacharyGodfrey) and my full [work history](/work) is available if that interests you.

I believe that the world is a better place when we understand how it works: the less my work gets called *magic* the better. I love explaining technical concepts to people in simple terms. I also love simplifying things and reducing complexity whenever possible.

## Personal Projects

### Axe Charts

I created [Axe Charts](https://axecharts.com) to supplement the official stats website for IATF axe throwing. In addition to providing in-depth performance statistics for Premier axe throwers, the site also addresses some key requests from the axe throwing community.

*Badges* provide fun performance milestones to work toward while chasing down that elusive 81 score and the *Axe Charts Rating (ACR)* is an alternative rating system based on overall accuracy rather than wins and losses.
