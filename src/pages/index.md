Hey, I'm *Zach*. I'm a husband and father, [Senior Software Engineer](#work), and the [creator of Axe Charts](#axe-charts). I live in Florida with my wife, Claire. We have a son and a daughter on the way. In my spare time, I throw axes competitively in the [IATF](https://axescores.com/player/1207260).

# Work

I believe that the world is a better place when we understand how it works. The less my work gets called *magic* the better. I love explaining technical concepts to people in simple terms. I also love simplifying things and reducing complexity whenever possible.

If you also value simplicity, understanding, and sharing knowledge then we'd probably make a great team! If you'd like to chat, I'm available on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/zachary-godfrey) and via [email](mailto:contact@zacharygodfrey.dev). My code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ZacharyGodfrey) and my [work history](/work) is available if that interests you.

# Axe Charts

I created [Axe Charts](https://axecharts.com) to supplement the official stats website for IATF axe throwing. In addition to providing in-depth performance statistics for Premier axe throwers, the site also addresses some key requests from the axe throwing community.

*Badges* provide fun performance milestones to work toward while chasing down that elusive 81 score and the *Axe Charts Rating (ACR)* is an alternative rating system based on overall accuracy rather than wins and losses.

I often have thoughts. I occasionally write them down. I hope you find them helpful.
