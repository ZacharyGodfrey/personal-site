## Hello!

<div class="md-indent"></div>

:wave: **Hey, I'm Zach.** I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [The Knot](https://theknot.com), a husband and father, and a competitive axe thrower.

### Work

<div class="md-indent"></div>

:computer: I have *over a decade* of [experience](/work) building and maintaining software in a variety of languages and tech stacks. Most of my professional work has been on internal systems that cannot be shared or backend systems that aren't visible.

<div class="md-indent"></div>

:sunny: Because of this, I don't have a portfolio of work to show. You can check out my personal [projects](/projects) to see what I've built outside of work.

### Play

<div class="md-indent"></div>

:axe: I [throw axes](https://axescores.com/player/1207260) competitively in the IATF. In my first year in the sport, I qualified for and competed in the *2023 International Axe Throwing Championship*. From more than 20,000 throwers worldwide, the top 256 were selected to compete in the event. I placed 97th overall, which is in the top half for the tournament and the top 0.5% globally.

### Writing

<div class="md-indent"></div>

:thought_balloon: I like to use [Haiku](/haiku) poems to introduce topics that I find interesting. Each one is a 17 syllable summary in the 5-7-5 format with a link to learn more about the subject.

<div class="md-indent"></div>

:teddy_bear: I've made up a few original [bedtime stories](/bedtime-stories) for my kids.
