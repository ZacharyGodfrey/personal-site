## Work

:computer: I have *over a decade* of [experience](/work) building and maintaining software in a variety of languages and tech stacks. Most of my professional work has been on internal systems that cannot be shared or backend systems that aren't visible. Because of this, I don't have a portfolio of work to show.

:sunny: You can check out my personal [projects](/projects) to see what I've built outside of work.

## Writing

:thought_balloon: I like to use [Haiku](/haiku) poems to introduce topics that I find interesting.

:teddy_bear: I've made up a few original [bedtime stories](/bedtime-stories) for my kids.
