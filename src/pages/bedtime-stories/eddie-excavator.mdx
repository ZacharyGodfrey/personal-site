A [bedtime story](/bedtime-stories)

**Once upon a time...**

There was an excavator named Eddie. Eddie worked on a construction site with other big trucks, and his job was to dig holes.

One day, Eddie was listening to music while he worked and he got a little carried away. He started digging a small hole, but when the music stopped he looked up and realized that he had dug a very deep hole. It was so deep that he couldn't get out!

Eddie called out to his friends for help, "Guys! Help! I'm stuck in here."

The other trucks stopped working and came to see how they could help Eddie. Crane Truck said, "Maybe I can lift you out with my boom." He lowered his boom down into the hole and Eddie grabbed it with his scoop. Crane Truck raised his boom and pulled as hard as he could, but he couldn't lift Eddie out of the hole, "I'm sorry Eddie, but you're too heavy to lift."

The other trucks thought about how they could work together to get Eddie out of the hole. Dump Truck said, "I could get some dirt and dump it at the edge of the hole, and then Bulldozer can push the dirt into the hole to make a ramp on one side." Eddie responded, "Great idea! Then I can drive up the dirt ramp and out of the hole!"

The trucks got to work building the dirt ramp for Eddie, and then he tried to drive up and out of the hole. When he started driving up the ramp, the dirt began to slide out from under him. "It's not working, it's not stable," Eddie called out.

Cement Mixer had an idea, "I could pour some cement over the dirt ramp. When it dries, it should be stable enough to drive on without slipping." After the cement was poured and dried, Eddie tried to drive up the cement ramp to get out of the hole. He made it half way up before he started to slide back down, "The ramp is stable, but it's too steep. I can't drive up on my own."

Crane Truck found another way to help Eddie, "I can help pull you up the ramp as you drive so that you won't slide back down." He lowered his boom into the hole, Eddie grabbed it with his scoop, and Crane Truck raised his boom and pulled as Eddie drove up the cement ramp.

With the help of all his friends, Eddie was able to get out of the deep hole, "Thanks guys! You saved me!"

**The end.**
