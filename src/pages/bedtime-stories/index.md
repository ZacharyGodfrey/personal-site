### Background

When I started flossing and brushing my son's teeth at bedtime, he was very uncooperative. In order to get him to sit still, I started telling him stories. At first, I was just giving him summaries of old Pixar movies that he hadn't seen yet. I got bored of retelling the same stories night after night, so I started making up my own stories to tell him.

### Format

Each story starts and ends the same way. This is intentional: it makes story time a very consistent part of our nightly routine and lets my son know when it's time to sit still and when he can jump up and move on to the next thing. It's not very original, but it serves our purposes quite well.

Every story begins with "*Once upon a time...*" and ends with "*The end.*"
