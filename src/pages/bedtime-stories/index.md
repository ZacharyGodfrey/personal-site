When I started flossing and brushing my son's teeth at bedtime, he was very uncooperative. In order to get him to sit still, I started telling him stories. At first, I was just giving him summaries of old Pixar movies that he hadn't seen yet. I got bored of retelling the same stories night after night, so I started making up my own stories to tell him.

Some of these stories draw inspiration from existing children's books and movies, but they all have my own twist on them. Every story starts with **Once upon a time...** and ends with **The end.** This is intentionally unoriginal and provides two things for my intended audience: **1)** it makes story time a very consistent part of our nightly routine, and **2)** he knows when it's time to sit still and listen and when he can jump up and move on to the next thing.
