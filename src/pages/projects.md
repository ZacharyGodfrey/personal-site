## Personal Projects

### Axe Charts

I created [Axe Charts](https://axecharts.com) to supplement the official stats website for IATF axe throwing. In addition to providing in-depth performance statistics for Premier axe throwers, the site also addresses some key requests from the axe throwing community.

*Badges* provide fun performance milestones to work toward while chasing down that elusive 81 score and the *Axe Charts Rating (ACR)* is an alternative rating system based on overall accuracy rather than wins and losses.
