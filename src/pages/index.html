<section id="about" class="bar-x">
  <p>Hey, I'm <em>Zach</em>. I'm a husband and father, <a href="#work">Senior Software Engineer</a>, and the <a href="#axe-charts">creator of Axe Charts</a>.</p>

  <p>I live in Florida with my wife, Claire. We have a son and a daughter. In my spare time, I throw axes competitively in the <a target="_blank" href="https://axescores.com/player/1207260">IATF</a>.</p>

  <h2>Work</h2>

  <p>I believe that the world is a better place when we understand how it works. The less my work gets called <em>magic</em> the better. I love explaining technical concepts to people in simple terms and leaving their map of understanding a little less foggy than I found it. I also love simplifying things and reducing complexity whenever possible.</p>

  <p>If you also value simplicity, understanding, and sharing knowledge then we'd probably make a great team!</p>

  <p>If you'd like to chat, I'm available on <a target="_blank" href="https://linkedin.com/in/zachary-godfrey">LinkedIn</a> and via <a target="_blank" href="mailto:contact@zacharygodfrey.dev">email</a>. My code is on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ZacharyGodfrey">GitHub</a> and my <a href="/work">work history</a> is available if that interests you.</p>

  <h2>Axe Charts</h2>

  <p>I created <a target="_blank" href="https://axecharts.com">Axe Charts</a> to supplement the official stats website for IATF axe throwing. In addition to providing in-depth performance statistics for Premier axe throwers, the site also addresses some key requests from the axe throwing community.</p>

  <p>Badges provide fun performance milestones to work toward while chasing down that elusive 81 score, and the Axe Charts Rating (ACR) is an alternative rating system based on overall accuracy rather than wins and losses.</p>
