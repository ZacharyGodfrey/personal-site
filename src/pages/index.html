<section id="about">
  <p>Hey, I'm <strong>Zach</strong>. I'm a husband and father, <a href="#work">Senior Software Engineer</a>, and the <a href="#axe-charts">creator of Axe Charts</a>. I live in Florida with my wife, Claire. We have a son and a daughter.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, I throw axes competitively in the <a target="_blank" href="https://axescores.com/player/1207260">IATF</a>. During my first year in the sport, I qualified for and competed in the 2023 International Axe Throwing Championship where I finished 97<sup>th</sup> out of 256 competitors.</p>

  <h2>Work</h2>

  <p>I believe that simplicity is the measure of quality work. If you can't solve the problem simply, then you haven't fully understood the problem - and if you can't explain your solution simply, then you haven't fully understood the solution either. honesty and curiosity are essential for producing good work, that simplicity is the measure of quality, and that there is something to be learned from everyone you meet.</p>

  <p>If you share these values then we'd probably make a great team! I'm available for contact on <a target="_blank" href="https://linkedin.com/in/zachary-godfrey">LinkedIn</a> and via <a target="_blank" href="mailto:contact@zacharygodfrey.dev">email</a>. My code is on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ZacharyGodfrey">GitHub</a>, and my work history is listed <a href="/work">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>Axe Charts</h2>

  <p>I created <a target="_blank" href="https://axecharts.com">Axe Charts</a> to supplement the official stats website for IATF axe throwing. In addition to providing in-depth performance statistics for Premier axe throwers, the site also addresses some key requests from the axe throwing community.</p>

  <p>Badges provide fun performance milestones to work toward while chasing down that elusive 81 score, and the Axe Charts Rating (ACR) is an alternative to the existing rating system that many feel is not a good fit for the sport.</p>
