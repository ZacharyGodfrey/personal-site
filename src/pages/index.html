  <p>Hey, I'm Zach. I believe that the less my work gets called <em>magic</em> the better. I combat complexity at every turn and I love explaining technical concepts in simple terms for non-engineers. I'm currently building software at <a target="_blank" href="https://theknot.com">The Knot</a>.</p>

  <h2>My Career</h2>

  <h3>A Principled Approach</h3>

  <p>I have two guiding principles that have shaped the way I build software:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Integrity:</strong>
      <span>Do what's right regardless of the consequences.</span>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Craftsmanship:</strong>
      <span>Do it to the best of your ability every time.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>A Focus on Understanding</h3>

  <p>In every position I've held, one of my main focuses has been sharing knowledge and increasing understanding. I believe that the less my work gets called <em>magic</em> the better! I love explaining complex technical concepts in simple terms for non-technical people. I've found that bridging the gap between engineers and non-engineers brings many benefits to my team and anyone who interacts with us.</p>

  <p>When it comes to code, it's not enough to solve the problem; the solution must be written in a way that won't feel cryptic to others (or my future self). When the code is easy to read and follow, new team members can get up to speed faster with a more shallow learning curve, new features are easier to add, bugs are less likely to occur, and when bugs do show up they are easier to find and fix.</p>

  <h3>More Info</h3>

  <p>If you share the values I've described, then we'd probably make a great team! If you're looking for more information about my previous work, you can check out my resume or GitHub profile.</p>
