  <h2>Work</h2>

  <p>I believe that honesty and curiosity are essential for producing quality work. I think there is something to be learned from everyone you meet. I enjoy sharing knowledge with others. I value simplicity and ease of understanding.</p>

  <p>If you share these values then we'd probably make a great team! I'm available for contact on <a target="_blank" href="https://linkedin.com/in/zachary-godfrey">LinkedIn</a> and via <a target="_blank" href="mailto:contact@zacharygodfrey.dev">email</a>. My code is on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ZacharyGodfrey">GitHub</a>, and my work history is listed <a href="/work">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>Axe Charts</h2>

  <p>I created <a target="_blank" href="https://axecharts.com">Axe Charts</a> to supplement the official stats website for IATF axe throwing. In addition to providing in-depth performance statistics for Premier axe throwers, the site also addresses some key requests from the axe throwing community.</p>

  <p>Badges provide fun performance milestones to work toward while chasing down that elusive 81 score, and the Axe Charts Rating (ACR) is an alternative to the existing rating system that many feel is not a good fit for the sport.</p>

  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>I live in Florida with my wife, Claire. We have a son and a daughter.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, I throw axes competitively in the <a target="_blank" href="https://axescores.com/player/1207260">IATF</a>. During my first year in the sport, I qualified for and competed in the 2023 International Axe Throwing Championship where I finished 97th out of 256 competitors.</p>
