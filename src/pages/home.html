        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hey, my name is Zach. I'm a senior software engineer based in Florida and I've been building software since 2013. I'm currently working at <a target="_blank" href="https://theknot.com">The Knot</a>.</p>

        <p>When I'm not working, you can usually find me <a target="_blank" href="https://axescores.com/player/1207260">throwing axes</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chess.com/member/pro_zach">playing chess</a>, and hanging out with my family.</p>

    <h2>My Career</h2>

    <h3>A Principled Approach</h3>

    <p>I have two guiding principles that have shaped the way I build software:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Integrity:</strong>
        <span>Do what's right regardless of the consequences.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Craftsmanship:</strong>
        <span>Do it to the best of your ability every time.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A Focus on Understanding</h3>

    <p>In every position I've held, one of my main focuses has been sharing knowledge and increasing understanding. I believe that the less my work gets called <em>magic</em> the better! I love explaining complex technical concepts in simple terms for non-technical people. I've found that bridging the gap between engineers and non-engineers brings many benefits to my team and anyone who interacts with us.</p>

    <p>When it comes to code, it's not enough to solve the problem; the solution must be written in a way that won't feel cryptic to others (or my future self). When the code is easy to read and follow, new team members can get up to speed faster with a more shallow learning curve, new features are easier to add, bugs are less likely to occur, and when bugs do show up they are easier to find and fix.</p>

    <h3>More Info</h3>

    <p>If you share the values I've described, then we'd probably make a great team! If you're looking for more information about my previous work, you can check out my resume or GitHub profile.</p>
