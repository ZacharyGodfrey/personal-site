## Personal Projects

I believe that playing is the act of learning. My personal projects almost never see the light of day because they're usually the product of my playing around rather than building a finished product for others. At work I keep my code strictly professional, but on my own I love to run in the opposite direction of *"industry best practices"* to see if there's wisdom to be found where nobody else is looking.

My personal code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ZacharyGodfrey) if you're curious.

### Axe Charts

I created [Axe Charts](https://axecharts.com) to supplement the official stats website for IATF axe throwing. In addition to providing in-depth performance statistics for Premier axe throwers, the site also implements some key feature requests from the axe throwing community:

- [Badges](https://axecharts.com/badges) provide fun performance milestones to work toward while chasing down that elusive 81 score.
- The [Axe Charts Rating (ACR)](https://axecharts.com/rating-system) is an alternative rating system based on overall accuracy rather than wins and losses.
