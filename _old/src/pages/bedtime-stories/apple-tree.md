**Once upon a time...**

A red apple fell from its tree, rolled through the grass, and found a place to put down roots.

The seeds in the apple's core began to sprout into a new little apple tree. The roots grew down into the soil, and the stem grew up toward the sunlight. The apple provided nutrients for the young tree. The rain came and watered it, then the sun returned to give it more energy. The tree had everything it needed to grow strong and tall.

Over time, the apple tree matured and began to produce apples of its own. When the apples were ready, the tree let them go and watched as they went out to sprout trees of their own. The tree smiled as it watched its apples grow up into a whole orchard of new apple trees.

A young man left his parents' home, came into the orchard, and found a place to put down roots.

The tree had become old, and it stopped producing apples. The man chopped the tree down and used the wood from the tree to build a house in the spot where the tree had been. The man had everything he needed to build a house that was strong and tall.

Over time, the man got married and the couple began to have children of their own. When the children were ready, the man let them go and watched as they went out to start families of their own. The man smiled as he watched his children grow up into a whole generation of new families.

**The end.**
